### How to contribute to improve these notes?

For contributing, It'll be recommended for you to learn two things.

- [Markdown](markdown-resources)
- Basics of [Git](git-resources) and [Github](github-resources) usage 

Markdown is a quite simple markup language, which you can get started using within 1 hour of learning. Its simpler than you'd expect.

Git is a version control system, quite oftenly used in development work. Its very useful for any type of file based collaborative work. Github is a medium through which the functionality of git is extended via the web. We'll use Git and Github for writing notes, since this notes project is meant to be a collaborative project. Git and Github are something you'll find inevitebly useful when working on development. Consider it also an opportunity to get started learning it since you'are anyway going to learn it in future. It'll take around 10-15 hours to get started using Git and Github at a basic level. So get yourself armed with these tools and come back for contributing.
