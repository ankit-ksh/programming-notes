## **Why a new notes platform? What's different?**

There are numerous tutorials on the internet for everything that we might be interested to learn. So the why question needs to be answered ðŸ˜‰

First of all, its for a specific purpose of providing all reading materials and relevant resources for Computer Science subjects, strictly following the course syllabi of university courses. So it can be a place to efficiently use it for revising the course material. It'll be authored by students only, collaboratively via Github.

The site has Notes as well as curated list of best resources from across the internet.
